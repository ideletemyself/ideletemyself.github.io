# New Gorillaz Song & Music video


It's been six years since the last [Gorillaz](http://gorillaz.com/) release, *[The Fall](http://thefall.gorillaz.com/)*. Far, far too long. In that time we've seen a lot happen. [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit), the deaths of countless celebrities, the election of now President Donald Trump and that was just in the last year 2016. It's been more than ten years since their seminal release *[Demon Days]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Days*. More than **TEN YEARS**! A question then bears asking. Are [Gorillaz](http://gorillaz.com/) even relevant anymore?

### Things No Other Band Can Do


The luxury of being an animated band is that they never age. They can always be adapted. It's not the same as looking at a traditional pop star. When you see Lady Gaga for example you know what you're going to get for the most part. Not so with [Gorillaz](http://gorillaz.com/). It could be a rock song or have a couple famous rappers in it. Perhaps it's a song with some relative unknown with an amazing voice. It'll probably get your body moving no matter what it is.


### Well That Was Different


So with no further ado here's their new music video [Hallelujah Money featuring Benjamin Clementine](https://youtu.be/CDUrpPvU1_4). As I said before, you never know what you're gunna get with the Gorillaz and this song is no different. Check it out and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
