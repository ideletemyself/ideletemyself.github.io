<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Launch Of My Online Resume & Portfolio</h1>
<br>


These days it takes a bit extra effort to stand out from the pack. An ever growing and competitive pack. Luckily web technologies have advanced to the degree that creating an online resume or project portfolio for prospective jobs and clients to view is easier than ever before. With the help of free services like [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and software like [Jekyll.rb](https://jekyllrb.com/) there's no need for securing your own webhosting services for such a small, yet these days vital, project. An active web community of creators also helps with a wealth of options for boilerplates, assets and so much more.

The job market is a competitive place. More so than ever before many say. Some bosses and human resource types routinely have stacks of applicants all vying for the same position. How do they cut the wheat from the chaff? Just image how much text that person has to read. If you can make that job easier and stand out by adding graphics instead of just text that makes an impression. When you can refer a person to a website to view instead of just linking a PDF in an email it shows you have at least some skill and initiative.

If you're in an ever more common position and need to start sending out a resume`. I urge you to consider creating an online resume as well. [Google](https://www.google.com) is your friend or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) if that's more your thing. Either way there are plenty of guides showing how to get started. Then look at the many themes available. Choose one and off you go!
